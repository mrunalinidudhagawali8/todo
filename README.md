## Note
Kindly note that, this repo is just like a simple todo list, which would contain lots of POCs/new Java project ideas and have a scope to include much more except a ful-fledge project.

Any one interested, please feel free to create a branch and add your changes.

My current TODOs :
1. create a project for formatting json string in json format and custom exception class for throwing excetions
2. exploring different kinds of logging mechanisms in java
3. exploring different kinds of databases in java
4. exploring multithreading concepts, do multithreading file reading
5. create a web based project for comparing two different files of same format, eg comparing two json files
6. create a wiremock poc
